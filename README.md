# Modelling Formula 1 Lap Time

This project will consider data from races from the 2022 Formula 1 World Competition.

This project accessed data from [FastF1](https://theoehrly.github.io/Fast-F1/) python package, which collects data from [Ergast API](http://ergast.com/mrd/).

Start exploring the package [Package Exploration](1.%20Package%20exploration.ipynb).

Collect and store data [Spreadsheets generation](2.%20Spreadsheets%20generation.ipynb).

Process and clean data [Data Cleaning](3.%20Data%20Cleaning.ipynb).

Plot data to help us analyze laptime behaviour [Plots](4.-Plots.md).

Plot gear change for the fastest laps of each circuit [Gear Plot](4.1%20Plot%20Fastest%20Lap%20Gear%20Change.ipynb).

Data Modelling using JAGS and R [Bayesian Models](5.%20Data-Models.md).
