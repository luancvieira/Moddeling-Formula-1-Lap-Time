# Modelling Formula 1 Lap Time

This project will consider data from races from the 2022 Formula 1 World Competition.

This project accessed data from [FastF1](https://theoehrly.github.io/Fast-F1/) python package, which collects data from [Ergast API](http://ergast.com/mrd/).

- [X] Start exploring the package [Package Exploration](1.%20Package%20exploration.ipynb).

- [X] Collect and store data [Spreadsheets generation](2.%20Spreadsheets%20generation.ipynb).

- [X] Process and clean data [Data Cleaning](3.%20Data%20Cleaning.ipynb).

- [X] Plot data to help us analyze laptime behaviour [Plots](4.-Plots.md).

- [X] Plot gear change for the fastest laps of each circuit [Gear Plot](4.1%20Plot%20Fastest%20Lap%20Gear%20Change.ipynb).

- [X] Data Modelling using JAGS and R [Data Models](5.%20Data-Models.md).
